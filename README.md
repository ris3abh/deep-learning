Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural_network.git
cd neural_network
Install Dependencies:
This project primarily uses NumPy for numerical computations. You can install it using pip:
bash
Copy
pip install numpy
Explore the Code:
Each directory contains specific components of a neural network. Start with the core directory to understand the base classes and move on to layers, architectures, and utils for more advanced implementations.
Usage
Running Examples
The examples directory contains example scripts for different neural network architectures. You can run these examples to see how the components work together:
bash
Copy
python examples/cnn_example.py
python examples/gan_example.py
python examples/autoencoder_example.py
Adding New Components
To add new layers, activation functions, or architectures, follow the existing structure:
Create a New File:
Add a new Python file in the appropriate directory (e.g., layers/new_layer.py).
Implement the Component:
Ensure your new component follows the structure of existing classes. For example, a new layer should inherit from the Layer class in core/base.py.
Update __init__.py:
Add an import statement for your new component in the corresponding __init__.py file to make it accessible.
Testing
To ensure your implementations work correctly, write unit tests for each component. You can use a testing framework like unittest or pytest.
