## This is a practice and implementation repository to create all the models in deep learning

1. data folder contains all the data files used for the respective projects
2. basic neruals contains implementation of neruons, MP neurons, perceptrons and network of perceptrons 
3. flght delay problem contains notebook where i have used various regression models to predict the flight delay using various attributes like weather, date, time, arrival country, departure country etc.

Thats all for now...
